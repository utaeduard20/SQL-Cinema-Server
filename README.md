# SQL-Cinema-Server
This is my first database created in SQL Server Management Studio, combined with the implementation of a C# code.
There will be a database in which an X number of movies will be entered, based on which, more
later can be found in an interface created in C #. With the help of C # we will be able to introduce other movies
are not found in the My SQL database. This makes it easier for people who have difficulty working with
My SQL server.
In the movies we have a list of movies and movie details.
The movie itself contained a title, dates and now added, file name, duration in seconds,
width / length in pixels and a User ID.
Then we will need a textbox in which the user can log in to access it
databases, hence and adding to new users, via: cbUser, Username, Password,
Date of registration, country code, identity code.
We need a textbox for all the files contained in this database: File Name, Size,
Type, user ID, file ID.
Finally, it is implemented if a main textbox (Main) containing Movies, Users, Files, more
exactly all the components for creating this database.
